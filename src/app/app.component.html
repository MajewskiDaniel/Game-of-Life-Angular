        >Conway's Game of Life, also known as the Game of Life or simply Life,
        is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton
        Conway in 1970. It is the best-known example of a cellular automaton.
        The "game" is actually a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is
        determined by its initial state, needing no input from human players.
        One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration
        and observing how it evolves.</span

      <h3>Game rules</h3>
      <span *ngIf="showRules"
        >The universe of the Game of Life is an infinite two-dimensional
        orthogonal grid of square cells, each of which is in one of two possible
        states, live or dead. Every cell interacts with its eight neighbours,
        which are the cells that are directly horizontally, vertically, or
        diagonally adjacent. At each step in time, the following transitions
        occur: <br />- Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies
        (referred to as underpopulation or exposure). <br />- Any live cell with
        more than three live neighbours dies (referred to as overpopulation or
        overcrowding). <br />- Any live cell with two or three live neighbours
        lives, unchanged, to the next generation. <br />- Any dead cell with
        exactly three live neighbours will come to life. <br />The initial
        pattern constitutes the 'seed' of the system. The first generation is
        created by applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the
        seed â€” births and deaths happen simultaneously, and the discrete moment
        at which this happens is sometimes called a tick. (In other words, each
        generation is a pure function of the one before.) The rules continue to
        be applied repeatedly to create further generations.</span
